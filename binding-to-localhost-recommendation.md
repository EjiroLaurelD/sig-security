## Binding to Network Interfaces
### Recommendation: 
Always bind to localhost rather than to 0.0.0.0 or any interface, unless there is a specific need to do otherwise. Binding to localhost reduces the attack surface of your application by making it only accessible to devices on the same machine.
Binding to 0.0.0.0 or any interface can make your application more vulnerable to attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in other applications or services on your network.


### Exemptions on when to bind to 0.0.0.0 or any interface:
In a case where it is absolutely necessary to bind to interfaces for the application to function; 
- Only bind to the interfaces that are necessary for the application to function.
- Use a firewall to restrict access to applications to authorized devices.
- Monitor your application logs for suspicious activity.
- Ensure to keep applications and operating systems up to date with the latest security patches.
